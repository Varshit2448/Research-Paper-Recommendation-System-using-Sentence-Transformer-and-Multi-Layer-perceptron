# Guide to Using the Research Paper Recommendation System  

Welcome to the **Research Paper Recommendation System** repository! This guide will walk you through understanding and running the code.  

## Prerequisites  
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8+  
- Necessary libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install torch sentence-transformers pickle numpy
  ```  

## Overview  
This system uses Sentence Transformers and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to recommend research papers based on content similarity.  

## Repository Structure  
- `Models/embeddings.pkl`: Pre-computed paper embeddings.  
- `Models/sentences.pkl`: List of paper titles.  
- `Models/Trained_model.pkl`: Trained MLP model for enhanced recommendations.  
- `main.py`: Main script to run the recommendation system.  

## How It Works  
1. The system compares your input title to pre-encoded embeddings using cosine similarity.  
2. It retrieves the top 5 similar papers from the dataset.  

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Varshit2448/Research-Paper-Recommendation-System-using-Sentence-Transformer-and-Multi-Layer-perceptron.git
   cd Research-Paper-Recommendation-System-using-Sentence-Transformer-and-Multi-Layer-perceptron
   ```  

2. Ensure the required dependencies are installed.  

3. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  

4. Input the title of a research paper when prompted. Example:  
   ```
   Enter the title of the Research paper: Natural Language Processing Advances
   ```  

5. View the recommendations:  
   ```
   We recommend you read these papers:
   1. Advances in NLP Techniques
   2. Deep Learning in NLP
   ...
   ```  

## Customization  
- To add new papers, re-encode them using Sentence Transformers and update the `embeddings.pkl` and `sentences.pkl` files.  
- Modify `main.py` for personalized output or additional features.  

## Troubleshooting  
- **Error loading `.pkl` files**: Ensure paths to models are correct.  
- **Dependencies not found**: Double-check library installation.
